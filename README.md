Scamper is a CMS written for Rails emphasizing high flexibility and a clean layout for administrative users.

The current version is far from complete, but does have the ability to import a database and display 80% of content from the AMP Content Management System.

Scamper is designed to interface with your existing Rails app as a Rails Engine.
